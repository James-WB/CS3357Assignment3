# CS3357Assignment3
Summary

We will create two applications (UDP_Client.py and UDP_Server.py) using the UDP protocol to communicate across a network that can corrupt or lose data packets. This means we have to implement the reliable data transfer protocol (rdt 3.0) we saw in our textbook. 

The second part of this assignment will be to test your applications using the tc command to create a queing discipline. The specifics are beyond the scope of this assignment but the basic premise is that this command allows us to introduce reordering, delays, and losses in the channel so you can see how your applications perform.
